# NLP_Project: Stock Sentiment Investment Analyzer
Created for working on NLP project (CS 6320)

**GOAL**


The overall focus of this project is to amplify stock market predictions. To achieve this, we will implement a natural language processing-driven sentiment analysis in combination with traditional financial forecasting. This system would provide more information for a user to confidently decide on which stocks to invest. Utilizing public sentiment from social media and 
previous stock data will reinforce the investment decision-making tool.

**Scope**


• Build an NLP model to classify stock-related news and social media posts as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.


• Use historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance to build a baseline price prediction model (Linear Regression, LSTMs, or Random Forest).


• Combine the sentiment score with price trends to generate a final "Investment Sentiment Score" (Buy, Hold, or Sell).


• Display results via a simple dashboard (e.g., Streamlit or Flask-based interface).




**Data Sources**


• Yahoo Finance API


• Google News API, Alpha Vantage


• Twitter API (Tweepy), Reddit API (Pushshift)
